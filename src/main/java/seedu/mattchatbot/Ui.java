 * it. Changing how replies look, or moving them to a different interface
 * later, then touches only this class.
 * <p>
 * A Ui works in one of two modes. The console mode prints replies to standard
 * output and reads commands from standard input. The capturing mode, built by
 * {@link #forGui()}, keeps replies in memory for a caller to collect with
 * {@link #takeShownText()} instead. The GUI needs the second mode because a
 * window has to be handed the reply as a string to put in a chat bubble,
 * whereas the console can simply print it.
